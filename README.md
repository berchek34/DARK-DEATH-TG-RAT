# Telegram RAT (Python)

👋 Hello everyone!

I created a Telegram RAT written in Python. Here’s what it includes:

## Features

1️⃣ **Builder (DARK DEATH.EXE)**  
When you open the builder, a menu appears. You enter your Telegram bot token (you can create a bot in Telegram via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)) and choose an icon. After configuring everything, click **"Build"** and wait.

🛠️ After building, a compiled code file (`Build.py`) will appear next to it. When this file is run on someone's computer, their Task Manager and Command Prompt will be blocked. You will then be able to control their computer through the same bot you created.

💬 If you use the program, feel free to share your impressions and advice in the comments. The program will be updated regularly.

📦 **Version:** 1.0.0.0
